Hello world, happy new year to everyone. Hope you are having a great start to 2019.

### Today, I‚Äôm going to share a short tutorial to quickly deploy the new **[Goerli](https://goerli.com)** Proof-of-Authority cross-client test network which was originally developed at [**ETHBerlin]**(https://ethberlin.com) in September 2018 and then we, [Afri](https://twitter.com/5chdn) (@5chdn) and [ChainSafe](https://twitter.com/chainsafeth) (@chainsafeth), have been actively developing **Goerli**. As of now, Goerli **is** supported in [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/g**o-ethereum), [Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum), [Pantheon](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/pantheon), [Nethermind](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind) and [**EthereumJS**](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-client).

#### If you would like to follow the current development of **Goerli**, fork the **Goerli** testnet [repo](https://github.com/goerli/testnet).

Let‚Äôs get started. These steps will work on any **UNIX system (Mac & Linux).** First, go ahead and create a **GCP (Google Cloud Platform)** account [here](https://cloud.google.com/) and then create a project. By default, Google gives $300 worth of free credits for a year.

Then, we need [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), it is an open source tool to easily create reusable and modular infrastructure deployment automation code.

To install it on **Mac,** you can use [brew](https://brew.sh/), if you don‚Äôt have **brew**, you can install it using this script. Once, you are done, then go ahead and install using the next command.

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

brew install terraform
```

If you are on any **Linux,** follow the quick walkthrough [_here_](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) to install Terraform. **Terraform** has some excellent documentation on how to get up and running quickly.

Next step, you have to create a *service account key* in GCP.

![GCP IAM](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/806/1*QW8rRWOD6N_05jZ576x4rA.png)

On the creation screen, give it a name and description. For the role access, make sure you give it **_Compute Engine Admin_** role. Next, create your key and download the **_JSON_** key. Make sure to **_securely_** store this file, this file is **_very very private and sensitive_**! And **_DO NOT EVER PUSH THIS FILE TO YOUR PUBLIC REPO!_**

![GCP service account key creation](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*fIB74o-aFsMmilzh9d3P7w.png)

Now that we have our necessary steps done, we will start writing our Terraform deployment script.

In your project directory, copy the **_JSON_** file which you just downloaded and then create a file called **_goerli.tf_** (you can name it whatever you want).

<iframe
                width="0"
                height="0"
                src=""
                frameborder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowfullscreen
              ></iframe>

This is what your Terraform file will look like. In the first block, we define the provider which is *google* for us, inside that we define the location for the *credentials.json* and your *project ID* which you will find in your project settings.

Next, we define our _virtual instance‚Äôs name, region, cpu, ram, hard disk, operating system, firewalls, and other necessary configs._

At the very bottom, we define our *startup script* where the list of commands will run after the virtual instance is created to do the basic housekeeping stuff like updating the **OS**, installing [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org) and [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) (the client which will be running Goerli at).

Now, in your terminal, run the command:

```
terraform apply
```

And, you should see your instance is being created in the GCP compute engine console.

#### Congratulations, you have successfully deployed your virtual machine on the cloud! üëè üëè üëè

Next, we will SSH into our newly created VM. GCP provides few ways to connect to your remote machine rather than traditional methods; creating and managing your SSH keys like other cloud providers so, we will use the **gcloud** utils. You need to have **gcloud** installed on your computer so, go ahead and follow the instructions [_here_](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install).

![gcloud command in GCP console](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3052/1*3Hat1Xt8itUFxqFHI9qDVQ.png)

Once, you SSH‚Äôd into your VM, go ahead and clone the **Goerli** testnet repo from [Github](https://github.com/goerli/testnet) into your home directory and then we will run a few commands.

```
geth init ./testnet/geth/goerli.genesis
```

This is to initialize **Goerli**‚Äôs **Genesis** block.

We are almost done, next, we will copy the *boot nodes (the IP addresses of the peer nodes)* to the ***geth** data directory*.

```
cp testnet/geth/static-nodes.json .ethereum
```

Now, we will boot up our **Goerli** node

```
nohup geth --networkid 6284 &
```

This will continue to run in the background. _6284_ is the network ID of **Goerli** so when running Geth we need to specify as the ‚Äî *goerli* hasn‚Äôt been merged to **Geth** master yet. Here is the [_link_](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/18121) to the PR.

You will see a file called *nohup.out,* where it stores the log. Now, if you do:

```
tail -f nohup.out
```

You should see the terminal output of **Geth** running the **Goerli** network.

#### Congrats, we are done here, you are successfully one of the peers in the **Goerli** network! üéâüéâüéâ

You can use the same Terraform file by just tweaking a little bit to automate your deployment to any cloud provider like AWS, Azure, AliCloud, DigitalOcean, or even Heroku. You can also customize the current configuration to play with it.
